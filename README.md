### Getting Started

Click [`use this template`](https://github.com/abigger87/huffplate/generate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if your repo already exists, run:
```sh
forge init --template https://github.com/abigger87/huffplate
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge install
```


### Blueprint

```txt
lib
â”œâ”€ forge-std â€” https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std
â”œâ”€ solmate â€” https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate
scripts
â”œâ”€ Deploy.s.sol â€” Simple Deployment Script
src
â”œâ”€ SimpleStore.sol â€” A Minimal Storage Contract
test
â””â”€ SimpleStore.t.sol â€” SimpleStore Tests
```


### Development

Install dependencies, compile your contracts, and test all with [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)!

```bash
forge install
forge build
forge test
```


#### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰


#### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
